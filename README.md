# AcademicAmbush

Academic Ambush: Apocalypse Semester is a visually stunning top-down 2D space shooter game set in a 3D environment with physics and assets to match. The concept was initially developed as a project for the ENGI 5010 - Software Design Course and the lore was inspired by the events of the faculty strike of Winter 2023 and how the lost time forced sudents to complete all the work of the semester in one month. Most of the lore and appearance based changes have not been a priority since this is a project which is graded according to the concepts taught in the course.

The Game has been developed using Unity 2021.3.19f1 (DX 11) and C# while following design patterns and principles taught in the course, which used Java. Visual Studio Code was the primary code editor, and GitHub was utilized for version control and team collaboration.

Other tools like Blender, Photoshop, Snapseed, and AutoCAD were utilized to create & modify some of the assets and prefabs. Resources like Unity Asset Store and mixkit were used to source models and sound effects.

The code is currently split into "Old" and "New," where "New" is the refactored set of replacements utilizing design patterns and principles for some of the "Old" code. The refactoring is ongoing and is due to reach a final state before the final submission.

The current build of the game implements most of the proposed use cases mentioned in the project proposal along with some extra features which got added over time as the design for the game evolved. We would recommend users to play the game using the supplied builds of the game for Windows, MacOs, and Linux, as manually building it introduces more room for error and issues to intervene the desired portrayal of the game.

To play the prebuilt game:

1. Run the appropriate application executable depending on which OS you are using.
2. Select start in the Main Menu
3. Use WASD and/or the arrow keys to move the spaceship.
4. Use the Escape key to pause the game and reach the pause menu.
5. Try to survive as long as you can, but if you lose, you reach the Game Over Screen.
6. Shoot or crash into powerups to gain better shooting abilities with more guns.
7. The volume can be altered at any point by going to the options from either the main menu or the pause menu.
8. Select the Quit option from the Main Menu or use the appropriate shortcuts for your operating system (e.g., Alt + F4 for Windows).

To build the game yourself:

1. Open the project from the Unity Hub and select the appropriate version (2021.3.19f1) before runnning the editor.
2. Go to File -> Build Settings and adjust the necessary settings for your own operating system and click on build.
3. Run the exectuable file to start the game and follow the same instructions above to play.

Enjoy!
